# Data Structures & Algorithms

Implementations of different data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn algorithms and data structures, while challenging myself to pick up new languages syntax to complete these exercises in those languages too.

## Getting started

Here are some useful commands to help you run the algorithms and data structures found in this repository:

### C++

To run the C++ applications you can use these commands in your cmd.

```console
callumhayden$ sudo g++ name.cpp
callumhayden$ ./a.out
```

If these commands don't work, I would suggest ensuring g++ is installed by runnig this command:

```console
callumhayden$ g++ -v
```

If the output doesn't tell you a version, you can get g++ [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html).

### Java

To run the Java applications, you can use these commands in your cmd:

```console
callumhayden$ javac name.java
callumhayden$ java name
```

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a step by step method of solving a problem. It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.

An algorithm is also used to manipulate data in various ways, such as inserting a new data item, searching for a particular item or sorting an item.

## Data structures

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. While there are several basic and advanced structure types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.

In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data.

# Data Structures & Algorithms

Implementations of different data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn algorithms and data structures, while challenging myself to pick up new languages syntax to complete these exercises in those languages too.

## Getting started

To run the C++ applications you can use these commands in your cmd.

```console
callumhayden$ sudo g++ name.cpp
callumhayden$ ./a.out
```

If these commands donÂ´t work, I would suggest ensuring g++ is installed by runnig this command:

```console
callumhayden$ g++ -v
```

To run the Java applications, you can use these commands in your cmd:

```console
callumhayden$ javac name.java
callumhayden$ java name
```

## Algorithms

Here are some websites I found extremely useful when learning algorithms and data structures:

* Big-O cheat sheet http://bigocheatsheet.com/
* Computer Science animated http://www.csanimated.com
* AlgoList http://www.algolist.net/
* GeeksForGeeks http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/

## Visualizations

Here are some visualization tools I used to help learn different algorithms:

* Sorting Algorithms http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/
* Algomations http://www.algomation.com/
